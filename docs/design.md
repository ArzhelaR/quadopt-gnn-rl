# What to do in this project?

# Quadrangular mesh adaptation
In order to learn how to modify a 2D mesh, we first implement a 2D game
that works on pure quadrangular meshes. Starting from a 2D mesh, the goal 
of the player is to modify the mesh by applying topological operations 
in order to improve the **mesh quality**. Here the quality is based 
on topological criteria only. More precisely, we consider the degree 
of nodes. The degree of a node is defined as its number of adjacent 
faces. Ideally:
- The degree of an inner node is 4,
- The degree of a boundary node *n* depends on the local geometry 
around *n*.
